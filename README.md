# Team-building Exercise

## Description
This is a command line application that allows a user to enter in a team roster and have it displayed nicely on a webpage. This project was created using TDD and OOP.

## Installation
* Clone repo to local directory
* npm install

## Testing
Tests are included for each class. Jest was used to test and is listed as a devDependency.

## Known Issues
The max length add-on to inquirer seems to block the validation messages from appearing for more than a brief moment. More research is needed to find a solution to use both methods of validation.
